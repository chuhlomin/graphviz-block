# Graphviz-Block

This is a Github Block for rendering Graphviz graphs.

See examples in [graphviz-block-demo](https://github.com/chuhlomin/graphviz-block-demo/)

[GitHub Blocks Technical Preview](https://blocks.githubnext.com).

## Local development

```bash
yarn # install dependencies
yarn start # start the dev server
# Or use npm, pnpm, you know the drill
```

When you visit [localhost:4000](https://localhost:4000) in your browser, you'll be
redirected to the Blocks app, but your locally-developed blocks will appear in the block picker.

(if you're using Safari (or another browser that doesn't permit calling `http` URLs from an `https` page), run `yarn start-https` and visit [https://localhost:4000](https://localhost:4000) instead.)
